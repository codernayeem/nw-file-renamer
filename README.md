# NW File Renamer
*Automate your **file renaming** task easily.*

This software is made with **PyQt5** and **fbs**.

# Features :
  - Here you can automate your file renaming task.
  - There are main **4** (four) division on what you want :
    1. **Change Extension** :100: : Change, add or remove extension from file name.
    2. **Suffix Prefix** :100: : Add a Prefix or Suffix to your file name (with and without extension).
    3. **Serialize** :100: : Here, you can serialize file using your format. Exp: *file_1.png*, *file_2.png*
    4. **Name Fixer** :100: : Here you can use different methods like: **replace**, **remove text**, **add text** etc.
  - Also you can give **condition** on which file will be renamed in 2 ways :
    1. **Only Allow System** :+1: : Here, you can set condition like matched extension,  contain a text etc. This system will only rename, if they passed these condition.
    2. **Ignore System** :+1: : Here, you can set condition just like Only Allow System. This system will not rename, if they passed these condition.
  - You will see which file is **renaming** / **failed** / **not allowed** / **ignored** in real time.

Just select your folders and say what to do and boom :100: :+1:
